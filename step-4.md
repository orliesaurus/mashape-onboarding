#Consuming an API

Each API has its own page, where different tabs are shown:

* Documentation: This area is dedicated to the documentation of the API by the provider, here endpoints and various parameters are listed.
* Pricing: Each API can be monetized through Mashape. An API Provider can set up monetization through the pricing page, while consumer can pick a pricing plan according to their needs from the ones available under this tab
* Overview: An overview of the API, as defined by the API provider.
* Status: The status of the API, it's uptime and latency.
* Announcements: A place where the provider can announce changes to its API, along with various Terms of Service.
* API Support: The first line of support for an API. API Consumers can open public or private tickets with the provider.

###Documentation tab
The documentation is the heart of one's API and probably the most interesting part of APIs hosted on Mashape.

1. On the left hand side a listing of all endpoints. Endpoints come ordered in functional groups when the provider specifies so.
2. On the middle of the page you can find all API parameters to perform and test endpoints. Note that you might have to change these according to what you want to achieve. Here are listed general instructions and description for each endpoint that will help you consume the API. Remember the Mashape Application you created in the previous step? When testing an endpoint you can select it from the dropdown menu from within this section. When navigating back to the dashboard and your application you will see statistics and analytics appear.
3. On the right hand side you can find the request generator. Simply select your choice of programming language and the same request will appear as a code snippet.
