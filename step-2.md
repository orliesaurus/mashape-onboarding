## Let's create an Application

When you consume an API on Mashape you assign it to an Application, by default this is the <code>Default Application</code>.

All APIs you've consumed on Mashape will be listed below grouped by Application.
You can quickly see the status of APIs in a glance.

There are two ways to create an application:

* From the dashboard clicking the Add application button
* From the site navigation toolbar

## Single Application Overview
After specifying the name the application (I picked 'new app') you will be greeted with the following screen.

<p class="image-center"><img width="100%" src='/imgs/new-application.png'></p>

On the left hand side:

* Upload App Logo: To help you identify your apps faster you can pick and upload an app logo from your computer.
* Overview: Summary of the APIs contained within this application.
* Quotas: ???
* General Settings: This view allows you to specify or rename your application, description and to delete the application.

On the top menu of this view:

* Filter: When you start having a lot of APIs within an application this is what you will be able to use to filter down for a specific API and its analytics
* Analytics Dropdown: Filtering by period and environment for analytics purposes
* Get The Keys: Retrieve your Development or Production keys, used as authorisation headers in all your API calls to Mashape when consuming one of the APIs from the marketplace. You can re-generate (and block previous ones) keys in case you misplace them or if you believe they might be compromised to ensure no one will consume APIs through your user account.

## Next steps
Now that you've created an application it is time to associate it and consume an API.
