* On the left handside you can find categories, which you can use to quickly navigate the marketplace.
* On the top additional filters will allow you to drill down in the marketplace depending on
	* Sort by: Relevance, Date, Popularity, Ownership
	* Price range: Free, Freemium, Paid
	* Display system: Stack or Block


For each of the displayed APIs you can see how many developers have consumed it. Once you consume an API you become its follower but you can also become a follower without consuming it.

Additionally the uptime of the API is shown. Mashape as the proxy between consumers and providers pings all APIs to detect downtime.

Finally you can star an API to show your support to the provider and developers community.

*If an API is private, a lock icon will appear next to its name. Such APIs are not publicly discoverable by others but you and the provider*

**Select an API by clicking on it and you will be taken to its documentation page.**
